The Vigilant Fox @VigilantFox·22h,2025-01-03T18:49:42.000Z,"BREAKING: Rep. Stacey Plaskett throws a fit, gets her mic cut off after questioning why reps of U.S. territories were not called on to vote for Speaker of the House.

“What was supposed to be temporary has now effectively become permanent. We must do something about this problem"
Kevin@kevindegods·3 janv.,2025-01-03T15:00:15.000Z,"He had it all at Goldman Sachs:

• Elite position
• Dream salary
• Peak of his career

Then in 2005, he walked away at age 36.

What he built next would transform Wall Street forever:"

Peter Brandt@PeterLBrandt·21h,2025-01-03T19:31:09.000Z,"Absolutely impossible for me to believe that ppl who consider themselves to be traders do not even keep the most basic of metrics
BTW, Sharpe, Win Rate and ROR are not legit metrics IMO"
Peter Brandt@PeterLBrandt·22h,2025-01-03T19:20:27.000Z,Best cash trade I ever saw when at CBOT. Cannot remember exactly year or levels (too lazy to look it up). Mid Aug & U/Z Corn was at big inversion due to short crop year. Cargill bot all the early GA/AL/MS/FL/LA harvest it could and silently railed it to Toledo and Chicago.
Yumi@samuraipips358·3 janv.,2025-01-03T12:00:03.000Z,"What does it mean to ‘adapt to the market’?

Many people misunderstand what “adapting to the market” means.
Constantly changing strategies or systems every time the market moves contradicts consistency.
So what does it mean to correctly adapt to the market?

Peter Brandt@PeterLBrandt·22h,2025-01-03T18:28:54.000Z,Right on Yumi. I do not trust traders who claim to constantly switch trading approaches to perfectly match new trading conditions. There are good times and bad times with all approaches.
